# Snake Machine Learning AI

This project is a simple ML/RL AI trained to play Snake game using Pytorch and Pygame

## Description

This project has been done using the tutorial of "Patrick Loeber" on youtube. 
The AI use a simple 2 double linear layer with a Relu. We set the Learning Rate to 0.001 and let it train by himself. We can see the concrete result around 100 Epochs, but a good feature to implement would be to let the agent be aware of his own body and make him not close on himself.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Pytorch
* Numpy
* Pygame
